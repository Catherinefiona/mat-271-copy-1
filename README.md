House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
Project Overview

This project explores the factors influencing house prices using Python and builds a linear regression model to predict house prices based on property characteristics.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle (Boston housing dataset)

Features:

House size (sqft)

Lot size (sqft)

Bedrooms

Bathrooms

Zip code

Target variable: House price (USD)

Tools & Libraries

Python

pandas, numpy

matplotlib

scikit-learn

Methodology

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis to identify relationships

Train-test split (80/20)

Model training using linear regression

Model evaluation using R² score

Key Insights

House size is the strongest predictor of price

Bedrooms and bathrooms increase price with diminishing returns

Location significantly impacts price but is not well captured by a linear model

Model Performance

Test R² score: 0.73

Limitations

Linear regression cannot fully capture non-linear relationships

Location-based effects require more advanced modeling

Future Work

Feature engineering for categorical variables

Tree-based and ensemble models

Model optimization and validation
